# NoahMediaStreamPlayer
Noah's experimental cross-platform video/audio player.
Depends on <a href="https://github.com/noahc606/NCH-CPP-Utils">NCH-CPP-Utils</a> which must be within the 'include'.

For now, there is no GUI. The video player loops the first valid video it can find within the folder it was executed ('bin/').
